  <title>Agents</title>

  <para>
    The agents collect information. They could be a "real" agent,
    based on a software agent, or a network agent, a non-physical
    agent, witout need of installing any software, that execute
    network tasks in Pandora Network servers, and showing information
    on console inside an Agent.
  </para>
  <para>
    For agents who need to install software onto remote systems,
    public key of the machine to be monitored needs to be copied onto
    Pandora Data server to be able to collect data, as it's specified
    in detail in Pandora Install documentation.
  </para>
  <para>
    Data collected from the agents are stored in small pieces of
    information called "modules". Each module store only a kind of
    data. Value of each module is the value of one monitored
    variable. The agent must be activated in Pandora's server and a
    group assigned to the agent. The data starts then been
    consolidated in the database and can be accessed.
  </para>
  <para>
    A network agent NEEDs to be assigned to a Network Server to
    execute network tasks. If you cannot see any Network Servers it's
    because you has not executed any Network Servers. Please configure
    and run a Network Server before trying to assign a network module
    to an Agent.

      You can define new agents. Once defined in Pandora console, its

      <para>
	The list of agents shows all the relevant the information
      in the following columns:
      </para>

      <para><emphasis>Agent:</emphasis> Shows the agent's name.</para>
      <para><emphasis>SO:</emphasis> Displays an icon that represents the
      Operating System.</para>
      <para><emphasis>Interval:</emphasis> Shows the time interval (seconds)
      in which the agent sends data to the server.</para>
      <para>
	<emphasis>Group:</emphasis> This is the group the agent belongs to.
      </para>
      <para>
	<emphasis>Modules:</emphasis> Under normal circumstances this
	field shows the values representing the number of modules and
	the number of monitors, both in black. If the status of a
	monitor changes to "incorrect", one additional number is
	shown: the number of modules, the number of monitors and the
	number of monitors with "incorrect" status, all in black save
	the last one.
      </para>
      <para>
	<emphasis>Status:</emphasis> Shows the "general" status of the agent
	through the following icons:
      </para>
      <para>
	<inlinegraphic scale='70' fileref="images/b_green.png"/> 
	All the monitors OK. It's the ideal status.
      </para>
      <para>
	<inlinegraphic scale='70' fileref="images/b_white.png"/> 
	No defined monitors. Sometimes nothing is monitored
	that could be right or wrong, and only numeric or 
	text data is reported.
      </para>
      <para>
	<inlinegraphic scale='70' fileref="images/b_red.png"/> 
	At least one of the monitors is failing. Usually we
	want to avoid this, and keep our systems in a healthy 
	green colour.
      </para>
      <para>
	<inlinegraphic scale='70' fileref="images/b_blue.png"/> The agent 
	doesn't have any data. New agents with an empty data
	package can have this status.
      </para>
      <para>
	<inlinegraphic scale='70' fileref="images/b_yellow.png"/> Colour 
	shifting from green to red. This icon indicates
	that the agent has just changed its status, from 
	'All OK' to 'we have a problem'.
      </para>
      <para>
	<inlinegraphic scale='70' fileref="images/b_down.png"/> When an agent
	is down or there is no news from it for 2 times the Interval
	value in seconds. Usually it is due to a communication issue
	or a crashed remote system.
      </para>
      <para><emphasis>Alerts:</emphasis> Shows if any alerts have been sent 
      through the following icons:
      </para>
      <para>
	<inlinegraphic scale='70' fileref="images/dot_green.png"/> 
	No alerts have been sent.
      </para>
      <para>
	<inlinegraphic scale='70' fileref="images/dot_red.png"/> 
	When at least one alert has been sent within 
	the time threshold of the alert.
      </para>
      <para><emphasis>Last contact:</emphasis> Shows the time and date of the 
      last data package sent by the agent, using a progress bar, 
      according to value of the interval. If you see the image 
      <inlinegraphic scale='70' fileref="images/outof.png"/>, 
      the agent has not send data during the interval. 
      Passing the mouse over the image will show you the last contact 
      in time and date format.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> The icon 
      <inlinegraphic scale='70' fileref="images/setup.png" width="15"/> 
      is only visible if you're and administrator and it's a link 
      to the "Manage Agents" &gt; "Update Agent" option in the 
      Administration menu.
