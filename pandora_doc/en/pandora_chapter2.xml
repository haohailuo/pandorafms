    Summarizing: User profiles in Pandora define which users can
    access Pandora as well as what each user can do. Groups define
    elements in common among various users. Each user could be in one
    or more groups at any one time. Each group has user profiles which
    are defined and attached to it. A profile is a list of things a
    user can do, such as view incidents, manage database or other tasks.
