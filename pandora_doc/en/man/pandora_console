Linux, AIX, Solaris

.SH DESCRIPTION

The Web Console is a web application that allows to see graphical reports, state of every agent, also to
access to the information sent by the agent, to see every monitored parameter and to see its evolution
throughout the time, to form the different nodes, groups and users of the system. It is the part that
interacts with the ﬁnal user, and that will allows you to administer the system.

The Web Console is written in PHP and no plug-in, Flash, Java or ActiveX is needed to access the
console, only a browser that supports HTML and CSS (IE5+ or Mozilla 4+). Pandora Web Console can
run in several servers, the only thing you need is to be allow to access Pandora Database, where Pandora
stores all the information.


.SH SYPNOSIS
.B Pandora Console and Pandora database
.br

.I  Pandora database install

Please look at MySQL install and management guide (http://dev.mysql.com/doc) to obtain information
about how to create a MySQL database, how to manage mysql users and give him/her privileges to
read/write in Pandora database. Remember that you must write the password of the root user in MySQL
database to enter mysql command line. This user is not the same of the Operating System. The root
password in MySQL is in blank by default (within almost all distributions), you must changed this
password with the MySQL command mysqladmin. Please be careful with this.
You need a database with name "pandora", you could rename it, but you need to reconﬁgure in server too.
To create the structure of Pandora database in MySQL Server you have the SQL script "pandoradb.sql".
It creates tables and indexes needed to insert information into Pandora database.
You MUST populate database with SQL script "pandoradb_data.sql",
it inserts data needed to run Web Console and default user (login: admin, pass: pandora) to access Pandora Web Console.
First create a database called "pandora", and set an user to be able to access this database:
.I mysql> create database pandora;
.br
Later, execute the next commands using a user with enough privileges to create tables and indexes for
pandora Database into your MySQL Server:
Designed to be open, modular, multiplattform and easy to customize.

.I cat pandoradb.sql | mysql -D pandora -u root -p

.I cat pandoradb_data.sql | mysql -D pandora -u root -p

You can also use the source command, if you are connected to MySQL, from the MySQL prompt:

.I  mysql> use pandora
.br
.I  mysql> source path_to_pandora_dbstruct.sql
.br
.I  mysql> source path_to_pandora_dbdata.sql

This example is valid using root user in MySQL
Now we will create an user "pandora" and will be given to it privileges from the localhost:

.I mysql> grant all on pandora.* to ’pandora’@’localhost’ identified by ’pandora’;

Keep in mind that users need access from Pandora WEB Console and from Pandora Server, if your
deployment has many subcomponents in different physical machines, you need to setup a MySQL user
with privileges to access from different locations.

If you get the error "Warning: mysql_connect() [function.mysql-connect]: client does not support
authentication protocol requested by server; consider upgrading" when authenticating Web Console, you
have to change the way the password is stored into the database:

.I mysql> set password for ’pandora’@’localhost’ = old_password(’pandora’);

Please note this user will be used by several pandora subcomponents (Pandora Server, Pandora Web
Console) to access database.

.B Pandora console install 

Prior to install Pandora console, you need the following dependencies and software needed:

.I Web server. Apache2 is recommended

.I PHP 4.3.x, or PHP 5.x. Both has been tested for Pandora 1.2

.I PHP Modules for MySQL, GD, session management and SNMP.

.I JpGraph, it is necesary to generate graphics. It has an open source license, you can download it in
http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/

To install Pandora Console, simply untar in your HTTP server publishing directory and set perms to
www-data or http user.

To setup Pandora Console, you only need to modify a ﬁle, include/config.php, where the following
variables are included in .php code:
.I $dbname="pandora";             // name of database for pandora)
.br
.I $dbuser="pandora";             // mysql user to access db
.br
.I $dbpassword="pandora";               // Password for mysql user
.br
.I $dbhost="pandora";             // Hostname or IP of mySQL server

If database is define and was correctly installed, you can now access:

.I    http://host:port/installdir/index.php

The first time you log there is a default admin user "admin" and password "pandora". It’s worth to say
that YOU MUST CHANGE CREDENTIALS BEFORE LOGIN FIRST TIME, change it or create another
account, give it administrator privileges, and disable this one.

If you cannot see the pandora console login page, it’s possible that you have problems with PHP instalation. When you
installed the Web, please check that PHP engine its running. Fist try to access to the server IP with a
browser. You must see the Welcome Apache page.

Remember that alter installing the PHP and the PHP module for Apache you must stop and start the
Server Apache. As an example, Ubuntu with Apache2:

.I     /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
  
.I   /etc/init.d/apache2 start
To verify the PHP and Apache integration you can create the ﬁle test.php with the following lines:

.I   <?PHP
.br 
.I    echo "<h1>TEST</h1>";
.br
.I     phpinfo();
.br
.I     ?>

Now, copy this ﬁle in the Apache HTTPDOC directory. This directory depend of the Operating System
or Linux Distribution, for example in Ubuntu this directory is /var/www and in SUSE is
/srv/www/htdocs), RedHat based distributions uses /var/www/html as well.

To check this integration, please use your browser to open the following URL:
.I     http://IP/test.php

Where IP is IP Address of your Apache server. If the integration is correct you will see in the browser a
text string with big font: “TEST” and a big table with a lot of info about your PHP installation.
2.3.2.1. Graphic reporting instalation

For correct graphic generation, you need to enter the full path to a TrueType font installed in your
system. By default a free truetype font is distributed with Pandora Console package, and placed in
./reporting/FreeSans.ttf ﬁle. Please check that setup directive $config_fontpath is well
conﬁgured.
Pandora 1.2 uses JpGraph for viewing graphics. JpGraph is a different project and has no relationship
with Pandora, so you need to install it. You can ﬁnd at http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/.
Download last version (2.x), and place all .php ﬁles from src directory into reporting/jpgraph
Pandora Console directory.
