  <title>System audit</title>
  
  <para>
    The Pandora's system audit shows all the actions performed by each
    user, as well as the failed logins.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    The system audit includes actions that somehow try to by pass the 
    security system: attempts to delete an incident by an unauthorized 
    user, attempts to change user profiles by unauthorized users, etc.
    Its main function is, however, to trace the user connections 
    (login/logout).
  </para>
  
  <para>
    The audit Logs can be found in the "System Audit Log" option of the
    Administration menu, ordered chronologicly.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    Filters can be applied to the Logs displayed to show only those of
    interest for the user, selected by the action the Log produces.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    The selectable actions are those actions stored in the Data Base
    at that time.

    <title>Statistics</title>
    <para>
      There isn't a special section to view system audit
      statistics. However, we could use a graph generated in the Users
      section to evaluate the actions of each user, as this graph
      would represent the total number of entries in the audit log for
      each one: the more active the user is the higher the number of
      entries.
    </para>
    <para>
      The graph will also show entries of invalid users, i.e., those
      entries generated by failed attemps to log in.
