       The  Web  Console  is  a  web  application that allows to see graphical
       reports, state of every agent, also to access to the  information  sent
       by the agent, to see every monitored parameter and to see its evolution
       throughout the time, to form the different nodes, groups and  users  of
       the system. It is the part that interacts with the ﬁnal user, and that
       will allows you to administer the system.

       The Web Console is written in  PHP  and  no  plug-in,  Flash,  Java  or
       ActiveX  is  needed to access the console, only a browser that supports
       HTML and CSS (IE5+ or Mozilla 4+). Pandora Web Console can run in  sev-
       eral  servers, the only thing you need is to be allow to access Pandora
       Database, where Pandora stores all the information.

       Please    look    at    MySQL    install    and    management     guide
       (http://dev.mysql.com/doc)  to obtain information about how to create a
       MySQL database, how to manage mysql users and give  him/her  privileges
       to  read/write  in  Pandora  database. Remember that you must write the
       password of the root user in MySQL  database  to  enter  mysql  command
       line. This user is not the same of the Operating System. The root pass-
       word in MySQL is in blank by default (within almost all distributions),
       you  must  changed  this  password  with  the MySQL command mysqladmin.
       Please be careful with this.  You need a database with name  "pandora",
       you  could  rename  it,  but you need to reconﬁgure in server too.  To
       create the structure of Pandora database in MySQL Server you  have  the
       SQL  script  "pandoradb.sql".   It creates tables and indexes needed to
       insert information into Pandora database.  You MUST  populate  database
       with SQL script "pandoradb_data.sql", it inserts data needed to run Web
       Console and default user (login: admin, pass: pandora) to  access  Pan-
       dora Web Console.  First create a database called "pandora", and set an
       user to be able to access this database: _m_y_s_q_l_>  _c_r_e_a_t_e  _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e  _p_a_n_-
       _d_o_r_a_;
       Later, execute the next commands using a user with enough privileges to
       create tables and indexes for pandora Database into your MySQL  Server:
       Designed to be open, modular, multiplattform and easy to customize.

       _c_a_t _p_a_n_d_o_r_a_d_b_._s_q_l _| _m_y_s_q_l _-_D _p_a_n_d_o_r_a _-_u _r_o_o_t _-_p

       _c_a_t _p_a_n_d_o_r_a_d_b___d_a_t_a_._s_q_l _| _m_y_s_q_l _-_D _p_a_n_d_o_r_a _-_u _r_o_o_t _-_p

       You  can  also  use  the source command, if you are connected to MySQL,
       from the MySQL prompt:

       _m_y_s_q_l_> _u_s_e _p_a_n_d_o_r_a
       _m_y_s_q_l_> _s_o_u_r_c_e _p_a_t_h___t_o___p_a_n_d_o_r_a___d_b_s_t_r_u_c_t_._s_q_l
       _m_y_s_q_l_> _s_o_u_r_c_e _p_a_t_h___t_o___p_a_n_d_o_r_a___d_b_d_a_t_a_._s_q_l

       This example is valid using root user in MySQL Now we  will  create  an
       user "pandora" and will be given to it privileges from the localhost:

       _m_y_s_q_l_>  _g_r_a_n_t  _a_l_l _o_n _p_a_n_d_o_r_a_._* _t_o ’_p_a_n_d_o_r_a’_@’_l_o_c_a_l_h_o_s_t’ _i_d_e_n_t_i_f_i_e_d
       _b_y ’_p_a_n_d_o_r_a’_;

       Keep in mind that users need access from Pandora WEB Console  and  from
       Pandora  Server, if your deployment has many subcomponents in different
       physical machines, you need to setup a MySQL user  with  privileges  to
       access from different locations.

       If  you  get  the  error "Warning: mysql_connect() [function.mysql-con-
       nect]: client does not support  authentication  protocol  requested  by
       server;  consider  upgrading" when authenticating Web Console, you have
       to change the way the password is stored into the database:

       _m_y_s_q_l_> _s_e_t _p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d _f_o_r  ’_p_a_n_d_o_r_a ’_@ ’_l_o_c_a_l_h_o_s_t ’  _=  _o_l_d___p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d_(
       ’_p_a_n_d_o_r_a’_)_;

       Please  note  this  user  will be used by several pandora subcomponents
       (Pandora Server, Pandora Web Console) to access database.

       Prior to install Pandora console, you need the  following  dependencies
       and software needed:

       _W_e_b _s_e_r_v_e_r_. _A_p_a_c_h_e_2 _i_s _r_e_c_o_m_m_e_n_d_e_d

       To install Pandora Console, simply untar in your HTTP server publishing
       directory and set perms to www-data or http user.

       To  setup Pandora Console, you only need to modify a ﬁle, include/con-
       fig.php, where the following  variables  are  included  in  .php  code:
       _$_d_b_n_a_m_e_=_"_p_a_n_d_o_r_a_"_; _/_/ _n_a_m_e _o_f _d_a_t_a_b_a_s_e _f_o_r _p_a_n_d_o_r_a_)
       _$_d_b_u_s_e_r_=_"_p_a_n_d_o_r_a_"_; _/_/ _m_y_s_q_l _u_s_e_r _t_o _a_c_c_e_s_s _d_b
       _$_d_b_p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d_=_"_p_a_n_d_o_r_a_"_; _/_/ _P_a_s_s_w_o_r_d _f_o_r _m_y_s_q_l _u_s_e_r
       _$_d_b_h_o_s_t_=_"_p_a_n_d_o_r_a_"_; _/_/ _H_o_s_t_n_a_m_e _o_r _I_P _o_f _m_y_S_Q_L _s_e_r_v_e_r

       If database is define and was correctly installed, you can now access:

       _h_t_t_p_:_/_/_h_o_s_t_:_p_o_r_t_/_i_n_s_t_a_l_l_d_i_r_/_i_n_d_e_x_._p_h_p

       The  first time you log there is a default admin user "admin" and pass-
       word "pandora". It’s worth to say that  YOU  MUST  CHANGE  CREDENTIALS
       BEFORE  LOGIN  FIRST TIME, change it or create another account, give it
       administrator privileges, and disable this one.

       If you cannot see the pandora console login page, it’s  possible  that
       you  have  problems  with  PHP instalation. When you installed the Web,
       please check that PHP engine its running. Fist try  to  access  to  the
       server IP with a browser. You must see the Welcome Apache page.

       Remember  that  alter  installing the PHP and the PHP module for Apache
       you must stop and start the Server Apache. As an example,  Ubuntu  with
       Apache2:

       _/_e_t_c_/_i_n_i_t_._d_/_a_p_a_c_h_e_2 _s_t_o_p

       _/_e_t_c_/_i_n_i_t_._d_/_a_p_a_c_h_e_2  _s_t_a_r_t To verify the PHP and Apache integration you
       can create the ﬁle test.php with the following lines:

       _<_?_P_H_P
       _e_c_h_o _<_h_1_>_T_E_S_T_<_/_h_1_> _;
       _p_h_p_i_n_f_o_(_)_;
       _?_>

       Now, copy this ﬁle in the Apache  HTTPDOC  directory.  This  directory
       depend  of  the  Operating System or Linux Distribution, for example in
       Ubuntu this directory is /var/www and in SUSE is /srv/www/htdocs), Red-
       Hat based distributions uses /var/www/html as well.

       To  check this integration, please use your browser to open the follow-
       ing URL: _h_t_t_p_:_/_/_I_P_/_t_e_s_t_._p_h_p

       Where IP is IP Address of your Apache server.  If  the  integration  is
       correct you will see in the browser a text string with big font: “TEST
       ” and a big table with a lot of  info  about  your  PHP  installation.
       2.3.2.1. Graphic reporting instalation

       For  correct  graphic  generation, you need to enter the full path to a
       TrueType font installed in your system. By default a free truetype font
       is  distributed with Pandora Console package, and placed in conﬁgured.
       Pandora 1.2 uses JpGraph for viewing graphics. JpGraph is  a  different
       project  and  has  no relationship with Pandora, so you need to install
       it. You can ﬁnd at http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/.  Download last  ver-
       sion  (2.x),  and  place all .php ﬁles from src directory into report-
       ing/jpgraph Pandora Console directory.
