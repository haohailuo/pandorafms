    <title>What is Pandora FMS?</title>
    
    <para>
      Pandora FMS is a monitoring tool that allows a system administrator
      to visually analise the status and efficiency of Operating
      Systems, Servers, Applications and Hardware Systems - such as
      firewalls, proxies, databases, Web servers, tunnelling servers,
      routers, switches, processes, services, remote access servers
      and so on. All integrated into an open and distributed
      architecture.
    </para>
    <para>
      Pandora can be implemented on top of any operating system, with specific
      agents for each platform. Pandora can also monitor any TCP/IP
      hardware system, as load balancers, routers, switches, printers
      and so on.
    </para>

    <para>Pandora architecture is formed of four main components:</para>
    
    <para>
      <emphasis>- Web Console:</emphasis> Pandora's user
      interface. The user controls and operates the system with
      it. Several Web consoles can be implemented in a single system.
      The Web console is written in PHP, and it lies on top of a database and a
      Web server. It is compatible with any platforms - GNU/Linux,
      Solaris, Win2000, AIX, etc. Although, the official supported
      platform is GNU/Linux.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The console permits the user to control the status of the
      agents, view statistical information, generate graphs and data
      tables, keep a system incident control. Moreover, it will be able
      to generate reports and change the alerts, agents, and user profile
      settings.
    </para>

    <para>
      <emphasis>- Core Server:</emphasis> Pandora Core server is the
      receptor of the data packages and generates the alerts - it is
      the brain of the system. Several servers can work alongside for
      larger systems. It has been developed in Perl and works over
      any platform, although, the official platform is GNU/Linux.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      The core server accesses Pandora database, which is shared with
      the Web server, and stores the processed data packages. The
      server is executed under the name of "Demon", and processes
      the packages stored in its file system. The data is generated
      by the system agents. Despite the server's low system resources
      comsumption and simple installation and operation, the core
      server is the most critical element of the system. The core
      server receives and processes the produced data, and fires the
      alerts and the events.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      <emphasis>- Central Database:</emphasis> At the moment the
      system only supports MySQL. The central database keeps all the
      information Pandora needs to work - agent data, settings, user
      information, incidents, system settings, etc. The system can use
      a MySQL cluster to store the information, or a High
      Availability (HA) solution for larger sytems.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      This database can work with any of the platform officially
      supported by MySQL. Pandora can be implemented with MySQL
      versions 3.0 and 4.0, although the latest is recommended.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      <emphasis>- Pandora Agents:</emphasis> They collect all the
      system's data. They are executed in each local system, although
      they can also collect remote information by intalling monitoring
      sytems for the agent in several different machines - called
      satellite agents.
    </para>
		
    <para>
      They have been developed to work under a specific platform,
      making use of the specific tools of the used language:
      VBSCript/Windows Scripting for Microsoft platforms (Win2000,
      WinXP and Win2003) and ShellScripting for Unix - which includes
      GNU/Linux, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX and BSD, as well as the Nokia's
      IPSO. Pandora agents can be developed in virtually any language,
      given its simple API and being open source.

    <title>Pandora Administration</title>
    <para>
      The web console is the tool used to administrate
      Pandora. It is written in PHP and doesn't need any
      third party software to work, neither FLASH, JAVA,
      nor ActiveX plug-ins. The Web console can be run
      over any web browser supporting HTML and CSS (IE5+
      or Mozilla 4+).
    </para>
    <graphic fileref="images/image001.png" valign="bottom" align="center"/>
    <para>
      Pandora administration is divided in the following
      main elements:
