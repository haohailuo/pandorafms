      Pandora FMS 1.2 has three kind of servers: Data server, Network
      Server and SNMP Server/Trap console. All of them could be
      installed in the same machine or in different machines, also,
      you could setup many of them in a High Availability environment
      or using it to manage highs loads of data.

    <sect2 id="dataserver"><title>Pandora Data Server</title>
    <para>
      To build <emphasis>Pandora Data Server</emphasis> you need to
      have the following perl modules and software installed in your
      machine. This packages could be installed using your
      distribution packaging system or using CPAN.

      You can find them at http://www.cpan.org or install using your
      default package instalation system. These packages are in the
      default distribution of Suse 9.1 and Debian 3.0 GNU/Linux. Also
      available for Solaris in CPAN repository.
      Next, you need to set the TZ (Time Zone) environment
      variable.

       To use SNMP fuctions it's needed also to have installed the
       net-snmp package. It's worth to say that to run modules of
       GENERIC_ICMP_DATA type (calculate ICMP latency time) Pandora
       Network Server must run with root privileges.
    </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2 id="snmpserver"><title>Pandora SNMP Server</title>
    <para>
      You need to install the NET-SNMP package which is included in
      all GNU/Linux distributions. You have to use the snmptrapd
      binary and copy or link it to $HOME_PANDORA/util, where
      $HOME_PANDORA is the instalation directory of Pandora.
    </para>
    <para>
      This binary gets the SNMP traps, generating a log that is
      parsed by the Pandora Server.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you are using apt-get shipped with Debian based-distros such
     as Ubuntu, this line could do the trick and can very helpful to
     install all the dependencies for the server in just one line:
     <programlisting>
       apt-get install libdate-manip-perl snmp libsnmp-perl libtime-format-perl  
       libxml-simple-perl libnetaddr-ip-perl

      Create the <filename>/usr/share/pandora</filename> directory and
      "gunzip" and "untar" here the
      <filename>pandora_server_1.2.tar.gz</filename> file.
    </para>
    <para>
      Create an user pandora in OS. Usually you do that in GNU/Linux
      with commands:
      <programlisting>
	useraddd pandora -d /home/pandora
	mkdir /home/pandora
	chown pandora /home/pandora
      </programlisting>
      This user will be used by the SSH transfers to the server, so
      this user will need a strong password.
    </para>
    <para>
      In the file
      <filename>/home/pandora/.ssh/authorized_keys</filename> we will
      add the public key of each agent which send data to Pandora
      Server. These keys must be SSH v2, OpenSSH DiffieHellman (DF) or
      RSA. To convert between keys you can use the ssh-keygen tool.
    </para>
    <para>
      Pandora Server will check and parse XML files sent by Pandora
      Agents and will insert the data into the Database.

      Check launch scripts (pandora_network, pandora_server,
      pandora_snmp) and check for pathnames in the first two variables

  <sect2 id="configuring_server"><title>Configuring your new Pandora Server setup</title>
  <para>
    After install Pandora Server, you will need to edit the file
    <filename>pandora_server.conf</filename>, where are defined the
    variables of the server configuration. File
    <filename>pandora_server.conf</filename> is a text file, you could
    edit with your prefer text editor, like emacs. This configuration
    file is common to all kinds of Pandora Server (Data server, SNMP
    Server, Network server), you also could have different copies of
    configuration file for each Pandora Server you have.
  </para>
  <para>
    Edit configuration file of Pandora Server, usually
    <filename>/usr/share/pandora/conf/pandora_server.conf</filename> or /etc/pandora/pandora_server.conf and
    take a look at the lines:
    <programlisting>
      dbuser pandora
      dbpass pandora
      dbhost localhost
    </programlisting>
    Please change them to your own data. For security reasons isn't
    recommended use the default values.
  </para>
  <para>
    These are default values, and all must be existing directory and
    filename and valid username, password and hostname.
  </para>
  <para>
    Remember: you need to create the directory /var/spool/pandora/data_in
    where Pandora Server will read and write data, sent by remote
    agents using ssh/scp. This directory must be owned or with
    permissions to write for user "pandora". If you don't have a
    "pandora" user yet, create it using the way we described above.
  </para>
  <para>
    You can run Pandora Server with an user without privilegues, you
    can use the user "pandora", it only needs to run /usr/bin/perl and
    access to <filename>/usr/share/pandora</filename> and
    <filename>/var/spool/pandora/data_in</filename> directories.
  </para>
  <para>
    This is true with all the components but with Pandora SNMP Console
    needs root user to open UDP port 161 (this can be solved setting
    SUID0 to the snmptrapd binary) and running the rest of the Server
    using an user without privileges.
  </para>
  <para>
    Also Pandora Network Server can be run using an user without
    privileges, but the GENERIC_ICMP_DATA type won't work, as root
    privileges are required to get ICMP latency times.
  </para>
  <para>
    Check the MySQL connection with the user and password before running the server
  </para>
  <para>
    Pandora Server distribution tarball includes a Posix/System V
    start/stop script for "daemonize" Pandora Server. It is possible
    that you need to customize, but its runs smoothly on GNU/Linux
    (debian, Suse) and Solaris 8 systems. It has start|stop|restart
    parameters to include it in your default init level directory and
    it creates a logfile defined in $log_file variable (by default is
    <filename>/var/log/pandora/pandora.log</filename>):
    <programlisting>
      /etc/init.d/pandora_server start

	change it or create another account, give it administrator
	privileges, and disable this one.
      </para>      
      <para>
	Remember that alter installing the PHP and the PHP module for
	Apache you must stop and start the Server Apache. As an
	example, Ubuntu with Apache2:
	<programlisting>
	  /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
	  /etc/init.d/apache2 start
	</programlisting>
	
	To verify the PHP and Apache integration you can create the
	file <filename>test.php</filename> with the following lines:
	<screen>
	  &lt;?PHP
	  echo "&lt;h1&gt;TEST&lt;/h1&gt;";
	  phpinfo();
	  ?&gt;
	</screen>
	Now, copy this file in the Apache HTTPDOC directory. This
	directory depend of the Operating System or Linux
	Distribution, for example in Ubuntu this directory is
	<filename>/var/www</filename> and in SUSE is
	<filename>/srv/www/htdocs</filename>). RedHat based
        distributions uses <filename>/var/www/html</filename> as well

      <para>
	To check this integration, please use your browser to open the
	following URL:
	<programlisting>
	  http://IP/test.php
	</programlisting>
	
	Where IP is IP Address of your Apache server. If the
	integration is correct you will see in the browser a text
	string with big font: <quote>TEST</quote> and a big table with
	a lot of info about your PHP installation.

  <para>
    &pandora; agents collect all system's data. They are executed in
    each local system, although they can also collect remote
    information by installing monitoring systems for the agent in
    several different machines - called satellite agents.
  </para>
  <para>
    This document describes the installation of agents in machines
    running over Windows and Unix operating systems.
  </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="a_role"><title>Generic role of the agents</title>
  <para>
    Regardless the platform an agent is running on, this is formed of
    the following elements: 
  </para>

  <para>
    A script (or binary application in Windows) that collects and
    sends the data to the server. For UNIX machines the script is
    called pandora_agent.sh and is executed directly from the Pandora
    agent folder.
  </para>
  <para>
    One or several configuration files where the values to be
    collected are defined. The file is called pandora_agent.conf both
    for Windows and Unix machines.
  </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="a_script"><title>Main Script</title>
  <para>
    The main script is the executable file that collects the data
    specified in the configuration file. It sends the data to the
    server in XML. In Windows machines application is installed as a
    service and is executed at the time intervals set in the
    configuration file. In machines running over UNIX the main script
    is run through a special script called 
	<filename>pandora_agent_daemon</filename>, and
    runs continuously in the machine as a process.
  </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="conf_file"><title>Configuration File</title>
  <para>
    The data collection in the host system is the gathering of
    independent data units, which are defined in the
    <filename>pandora_agent.conf</filename> file. The
    pandora_agent.conf file is divided in two parts:

    are:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist mark='bullet'>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      <emphasis>server_path</emphasis>: The server path is the

	      <filename>/var/spool/pandora/data_in</filename>.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      <emphasis>server_ip</emphasis>: The server IP is the IP
	      address or the host name of the Pandora server, where
	      the data will be stored. The host must be reachable and
	      must be listening to port 22 (SSH). If it's listening in
	      any other port, you would have to set it up in the option
              which manages the ssh port to connect to, also in the 
              <filename>pandora_agent.conf</filename>.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      <emphasis>temporal</emphasis>: This is the full path of
	      the folder where the agent stores the data locally,
	      before it is sent to the server. It must be said that
	      the data packages are deleted once the agent tries to
	      contact Pandora server, no matter if the communication
	      was successful or not. This is done to avoid over
	      flooding hard drive of the host system where the agent
	      runs. The location of the local folder varies with the
	      architecture of the host system. In Unix systems this is
	      usually <filename>/opt/pandora/data_out</filename>, and
	      in Windows systems

	      server. The recommended value ranges from 300 (5
	      minutes) to 600 (10 minutes). This number could be

	      <emphasis>debug</emphasis>: This parameter is used to
	      test the generation of data files, forcing the agent to
	      do not copy data file to server, so you can check data
	      file contents and copy XML data file manually. It does
	      not delete any data when the process is finished, so
	      data file will be in temp directory. The activity is
	      written in a log file. The file is named
	      pandora_agent.log. This log file can be used to test the

	      performed through MD5. If the value is 0, the checksum
	      is not performed at all. This may be useful for systems
	      where a MD5 tool cannot be implemented. If the checksum
	      is deactivated in the agent it must be also disconnected
	      in the server. Otherwise it could create problems.

      command). This directive executes a command and stores the

    <sect4><title>module_interval factor</title>
    <para>
      Pandora 1.2 introduces this new feature. You can, for each
      module, setup its own interval. This interval its calculated as
      a multiply factor for agent interval. For example, if your agent
      has interval 300 (5 minutes), and you want a module only be
      calculated each 15 minutes, you could add this line:
      <filename>module_interval 3</filename>. So this module will be
      calculated each 300sec x 3 = 900sec (15 minutes).

  It is possible to monitor virtually any system with Pandora. This
  can be done either with a local agent collecting data directly from
  the system to be monitored, using a a satellite agent collecting
  data from a system by SNMP or using the new Pandora 1.2 agents, the
  remote agents, who can chack using remote network polling (TCP, UCP,
  ICMP/PING and SNMP) remote services, from the Pandora Network
  Server.
