<a name="6"><h1>6. System audit</h1></a>

<p>The Pandora's system audit shows all the actions performed by each user, as well as the failed logins.</p>

<p>In the actual version of Pandora the system
audit includes actions that somehow try to by pass the security system:
attempts to delete an incident by an unauthorised user, attemps to change user
profiles by unauthoried users, etc. Its main function is, however, to trace the
user connections (login/logout).</p>

<p>The audit Logs can be found in the System Audit option of the Administration menu, ordered chronologicly.</p>

<p>Filters can be applied to the Logs displayed to show only those of interest for the user, selected by the action the Log produces.</p>

<p>The selectable actions are those actions stored in the Data Base at that time.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="images/image049.png"></p>

<p>The following fields display the Audit Logs information:</p>

<p><b>User:</b> User that triggerd the event (SYSTEM isspecial user of the system).</p>
<p><b>Action:</b> Action generated by the entry in the log.</p>
<p><b>Date:</b> Date of the entry in the log.</p>
<p><b>Source IP:</b> IP of the machine or the agent that provoked the entry.</p>
<p><b>Comment:</b> Comment describing the entry</p>

<h2><a name="61">6.1. Statistics</a></h2>

<p>There isn't a special section to view system audit statistics. However, we could use a graph generated in the Users section to evaluate the actions of each user, as this graph would represent the total
number of entries in the audit log for each one: the more active the user is the higher the number of entries.</p>

<p>The graph will also show entries of invalid users, i.e., those entries generated by failed attemps to log in.</p>
